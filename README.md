ðŸŒŸ Hey there, welcome to my data-driven corner of GitHub!

Iâ€™m a curious mind with a love for turning raw data into meaningful stories. Whether itâ€™s uncovering trends, solving business problems, or just making sense of the chaosâ€”we data analysts do it all (with a lot of Excel sheets and coffee â˜•ðŸ“Š).

Here, youâ€™ll find:

ðŸ“ˆ Projects where I explore and analyze real-world data
ðŸ§  Insights Iâ€™ve gained from working with SQL, Excel, Python, Power BI & more
ðŸ“Œ Clean dashboards, helpful queries, and visualizations that make data talk
ðŸ’¡ Tips, tricks, and mini-guides for fellow analysts, learners, and enthusiasts

If you're someone who loves decoding patterns, optimizing decisions, or just finds joy in a good-looking chartâ€”youâ€™re in the right place! ðŸŽ¯

Letâ€™s dive into data, learn from each other, and grow togetherâ€”one dataset at a time.
Iâ€™ll bring the visuals, you bring the curiosity! ðŸ“ŠðŸ’»âœ¨
